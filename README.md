## Overview
A single page application created using React.

## Running the Application Locally
Before you begin, ensure you have met the prerequisites, and then
follow these steps to run the application locally:  
1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project root directory:
3. **Install dependencies:** Install the project dependencies using npm.
   ```shell
    npm install
    ```
   Running npm install will ensure that your project has access to the required packages and libraries defined in the package.json file.
4. Start the development server:
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Once the development server starts,
   it will display the actual URL in the terminal. You can access the application by navigating to the URL shown in your terminal.

## Prerequisites
